/**
 * The framework-agnostic owner of an auth session on the server (SSR).
 *
 * Whereas SPA clients keep the session tokens in `localStorage` and accesses
 * the refresh token in client JS, an SSR client and host exchange the tokens
 * via cookies. This code orchestrates reading those cookies, refreshing the
 * access token against the server when it is missing or near expiry, and
 * writing the rotated tokens back as cookies.
 *
 * The {@link ServerAuthSessionConfig} class takes an injected `refreshSession`
 * callback, so it never imports Convex: a framework binding supplies one on
 * top of an HTTP client and a {@link CookieStore} built on its
 * request/response cookies, and tests supply a fake. The SSR host accesses the
 * refresh token (from the cookie), passes it in a refresh request to the
 * Convex backend and gets back a full {@link TokenBundle}. It uses that bundle
 * to update the cookie values and communicate the refreshed access token to
 * the client.
