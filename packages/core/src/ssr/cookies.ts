/**
 * A framework-agnostic cookie abstraction for server-side (SSR) auth.

 * SSR frameworks each expose cookies differently — Next.js has `NextRequest`/
 * `NextResponse` cookies in the proxy and `next/headers` `cookies()` in route
 * handlers and server components; other frameworks have their own. This module
 * defines the small interface the shared {@link ServerAuthSession} needs, so a
 * framework binding only has to adapt its cookies to {@link CookieStore}.
 *
 * Nothing here depends on React, Next.js, or Convex.
