  // A token's `state` is one of:
  //
  //  - `issued`: handed to a client, but not yet redeemed. Sign-in issues the
  //    session's first token, and each refresh issues another.
  //  - `redeemed`: presented once, so its holder evidently received it.
  //    Presenting it again issues another token and leaves it redeemed, which
  //    is what lets a client whose refresh response was lost (a device
  //    sleeping mid-request) retry with the token it still holds.
  //  - `spent`: a redeemed token, replaced when a later issued token was
  //    redeemed. Its holder has moved on.
  //  - `dropped`: an issued token discarded when a sibling was redeemed.
  //    Whoever holds it forked from the holder of the redeemed one.
  //
  // Presenting an issued token redeems it, spends the session's previous
  // redeemed token, and drops the other issued ones, so a session has at most
  // one redeemed token (none before its first refresh), and every issued token
  // descends from it. Presenting a spent or dropped token means the session's
  // holders have diverged, which revokes the session. Spent and dropped rows
  // are kept for `SPENT_TOKEN_HORIZON_MS` after `retiredAt`, then pruned.
