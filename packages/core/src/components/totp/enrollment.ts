/**
 * TOTP enrollment: the functions of the component that a signed-in user
 * reaches from a settings page to set the second factor up. The verification
 * of a code at sign-in is in `verification.ts`, and the functions that change
 * or remove an enrolled factor are in `management.ts`.
 *
 * A user may have up to {@link MAX_TOTPS_PER_USER} TOTPs in the "active"
 * status, one for each authenticator app, and at most one in the "pending"
 * status. An active TOTP is one that the user confirmed with a valid code
 * generated from the shared secret. A user with any active TOTP owes a code at
 * sign-in, and a code from any of them is accepted (see {@link getStatus} and
 * {@link listTotps}). A pending TOTP is one that is awaiting a call to
 * {@link confirmTotp} to move it to the active status. It can be confirmed
 * for {@link PENDING_ENROLLMENT_TTL_MS} after its creation.
