 * The password provider component.

 * holds no email/username and knows nothing about the identity behind a user id
 * — intentionally reusable in any context. The app owns the users table and
 * maps its own identifiers onto the `userId` it passes in.
 *
 * Mounts the rate-limiter component to throttle `verifyPassword` per user id.
