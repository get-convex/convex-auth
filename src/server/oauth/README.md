The code in this directory is meant to handle OAuth2 and OIDC flows.

The code is adapted from the @auth/core package, but since some of their types
and functions used are internal, they're copied over but with similar structure.

Everything that deviates from the original code is marked with a "ConvexAuth:"
comment.
