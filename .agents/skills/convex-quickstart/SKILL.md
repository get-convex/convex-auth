# Convex Quickstart

Set up a working Convex project as fast as possible.

## When to Use

- Starting a brand new project with Convex
- Adding Convex to an existing React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or other app
- Scaffolding a Convex app for prototyping

## When Not to Use

- The project already has Convex installed and `convex/` exists - just start
  building
- You only need to add auth to an existing Convex app - use the
  `convex-setup-auth` skill

## Workflow

1. Determine the starting point: new project or existing app
2. If new project, pick a template and scaffold with `npm create convex@latest`
3. If existing app, install `convex` and wire up the provider
4. Run `npx convex dev --once` to provision a local anonymous deployment, push
   the current `convex/` code, typecheck it, and regenerate types — all in one
   shot, exiting cleanly. The output tells the agent whether the schema and
   functions are valid.
5. Ask the user (or, for cloud agents, start in the background) `npm run dev` —
   Convex templates wire the watcher and the frontend into a single command. If
   the project has no combined dev script, use `npx convex dev` for the watcher
   and run the frontend separately.
6. Verify the setup works

## Path 1: New Project (Recommended)

Use the official scaffolding tool. It creates a complete project with the
frontend framework, Convex backend, and all config wired together.

### Pick a template

| Template                   | Stack                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `react-vite-shadcn`        | React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui       |
| `nextjs-shadcn`            | Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui |
| `react-vite-clerk-shadcn`  | React + Vite + Clerk auth + shadcn/ui     |
| `nextjs-clerk`             | Next.js + Clerk auth                      |
| `nextjs-convexauth-shadcn` | Next.js + Convex Auth + shadcn/ui         |
| `nextjs-lucia-shadcn`      | Next.js + Lucia auth + shadcn/ui          |
| `bare`                     | Convex backend only, no frontend          |

If the user has not specified a preference, default to `react-vite-shadcn` for
simple apps or `nextjs-shadcn` for apps that need SSR or API routes.

You can also use any GitHub repo as a template:

```bash
npm create convex@latest my-app -- -t owner/repo
npm create convex@latest my-app -- -t owner/repo#branch
```

### Scaffold the project

Always pass the project name and template flag to avoid interactive prompts:

```bash
npm create convex@latest my-app -- -t react-vite-shadcn
cd my-app
npm install
```

The scaffolding tool creates files but does not run `npm install`, so you must
run it yourself.

To scaffold in the current directory (if it is empty):

```bash
npm create convex@latest . -- -t react-vite-shadcn
npm install
```

### Provision the deployment and push code

Run this yourself — it is a one-shot command that exits cleanly:

```bash
npx convex dev --once
```

In a non-TTY environment (which is true for almost every agent run), this:

- Provisions an _anonymous_ local Convex backend bound to `127.0.0.1`. No
  browser login, no team/project prompts.
- Writes `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and the framework's `*_CONVEX_URL` variables to
  `.env.local`.
- Generates `convex/_generated/`.
- Pushes the current `convex/` code to the deployment, **typechecks it**, and
  **validates the schema**. The agent reads this output to find out if the code
  it just wrote is broken.

To be explicit (recommended), set `CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous` so the behavior
does not depend on TTY detection:

```bash
CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous npx convex dev --once
```

The deployment lives under `~/.convex/` and persists across runs. Re-running
`convex dev --once` after editing `convex/` files is the agent's main feedback
loop while the user-launched `npm run dev` is not in use.

If the template's `package.json` defines a `predev` script (Convex Auth
templates and similar do), `npm run predev` runs `convex init` plus any one-time
setup (e.g. minting auth keys). Use it _in addition to_ `convex dev --once` when
present — `predev` handles the one-time setup, `convex dev --once` pushes and
validates the code.

### Start the dev loop

In most Convex templates, `npm run dev` runs both the Convex watcher and the
frontend dev server together (typically `convex dev --start 'vite --open'` or
the Next.js equivalent). That is what the user should run.

```bash
npm run dev
```

If the project does not have a combined `dev` script — e.g. the `bare` template,
or an existing app where you haven't wired the frontend dev server into Convex's
`--start` flag — the user can run the Convex watcher directly:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

`npx convex dev` is the same long-running watcher `npm run dev` invokes under
the hood; it just doesn't start the frontend. Use it when there is no frontend,
or when the user prefers to run the frontend in a separate terminal.

Either way, the agent should not invoke the watcher in the foreground because it
does not exit. Two options:

- **Local development (user is at the keyboard):** ask the user to run
  `npm run dev` (or `npx convex dev`) in a terminal. The deployment provisioned
  by `convex dev --once` above is already selected, so the watcher picks up
  immediately with no prompts.
- **Cloud or headless agents:** start `npm run dev` (or `npx convex dev`) in the
  background.

Vite apps serve on `http://localhost:5173`, Next.js on `http://localhost:3000`.

### What you get

After scaffolding, the project structure looks like:

```
my-app/
  convex/           # Backend functions and schema
    _generated/     # Auto-generated types (check this into git)
    schema.ts       # Database schema (if template includes one)
  src/              # Frontend code (or app/ for Next.js)
  package.json
  .env.local        # CONVEX_URL / VITE_CONVEX_URL / NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
```

The template already has:

- `ConvexProvider` wired into the app root
- Correct env var names for the framework
- Tailwind and shadcn/ui ready (for shadcn templates)
- Auth provider configured (for auth templates)

Proceed to adding schema, functions, and UI.

## Path 2: Add Convex to an Existing App

Use this when the user already has a frontend project and wants to add Convex as
the backend.

### Install

```bash
npm install convex
```

### Provision and push

Run `npx convex dev --once` yourself to provision a local anonymous deployment,
write `.env.local`, generate types, push the current `convex/` code, and
typecheck it. This is one-shot and exits:

```bash
npx convex dev --once
```

The output tells you whether the schema and functions are valid — use it as your
feedback loop while iterating.

Then ask the user to start the watcher (or, for cloud/headless agents, start it
in the background). You have two options:

- **Wire Convex into `npm run dev`** — change the existing app's `dev` script to
  `convex dev --start '<existing dev command>'`. That's the standard pattern
  Convex templates use; the user then runs a single `npm run dev` to start both.
- **Run them separately** — leave `npm run dev` for the frontend and tell the
  user to run `npx convex dev` in a second terminal for the Convex watcher.

See "Start the dev loop" above for why the agent should not run the watcher in
the foreground.

### Wire up the provider

The Convex client must wrap the app at the root. The setup varies by framework.

Create the `ConvexReactClient` at module scope, not inside a component:

```tsx
// Bad: re-creates the client on every render
function App() {
  const convex = new ConvexReactClient(
    import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string,
  );
  return <ConvexProvider client={convex}>...</ConvexProvider>;
}

// Good: created once at module scope
const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);
function App() {
  return <ConvexProvider client={convex}>...</ConvexProvider>;
}
```

#### React (Vite)

```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";
import App from "./App";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
      <App />
    </ConvexProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

#### Next.js (App Router)

```tsx
// app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx
"use client";

import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL!);

export function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return <ConvexProvider client={convex}>{children}</ConvexProvider>;
}
```

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ConvexClientProvider } from "./ConvexClientProvider";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

#### Other frameworks

For Vue, Svelte, React Native, TanStack Start, Remix, and others, follow the
matching quickstart guide:

- [Vue](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/vue)
- [Svelte](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/svelte)
- [React Native](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react-native)
- [TanStack Start](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/tanstack-start)
- [Remix](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/remix)
- [Node.js (no frontend)](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nodejs)

### Environment variables

The env var name depends on the framework:

| Framework    | Variable                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Vite         | `VITE_CONVEX_URL`        |
| Next.js      | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` |
| Remix        | `CONVEX_URL`             |
| React Native | `EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` |

`npx convex dev` writes the correct variable to `.env.local` automatically.

## Agent Mode

`CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous` forces an unauthenticated local backend. It is
already the implicit default for any non-TTY run of `npx convex init` or
`npx convex dev`, but set it explicitly so the behavior does not depend on TTY
detection:

```bash
CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous npx convex dev --once
```

Use it for:

- Any AI coding agent (local or cloud).
- CI-like setup scripts.
- Cases where the user is logged in but you do not want to touch their personal
  dev deployment.

The resulting backend runs on `127.0.0.1` and is not associated with any team or
project until the user later claims it via `npx convex login` and the
`npx convex deployment` commands.

## Verify the Setup

After setup, confirm everything is working:

1. `npx convex dev --once` exited without errors (deployment provisioned, code
   pushed, schema validated, typecheck clean)
2. The `convex/_generated/` directory exists and has `api.ts` and `server.ts`
3. `.env.local` contains a `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` value and the framework's
   `*_CONVEX_URL` variable
4. (If applicable) `npm run dev` (or `npx convex dev` for the watcher alone) is
   running without errors in another terminal or in the background

## Writing Your First Function

Once the project is set up, create a schema and a query to verify the full loop
works.

`convex/schema.ts`:

```ts
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  tasks: defineTable({
    text: v.string(),
    completed: v.boolean(),
  }),
});
```

`convex/tasks.ts`:

```ts
import { query, mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const list = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("tasks").collect();
  },
});

export const create = mutation({
  args: { text: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.insert("tasks", { text: args.text, completed: false });
  },
});
```

Use in a React component (adjust the import path based on your file location
relative to `convex/`):

```tsx
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

function Tasks() {
  const tasks = useQuery(api.tasks.list);
  const create = useMutation(api.tasks.create);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => create({ text: "New task" })}>Add</button>
      {tasks?.map((t) => (
        <div key={t._id}>{t.text}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Development vs Production

Always use `npx convex dev` during development. It runs against your personal
dev deployment and syncs code on save.

When ready to ship, deploy to production:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This pushes to the production deployment, which is separate from dev. Do not use
`deploy` during development.

## Next Steps
