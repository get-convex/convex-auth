# Convex Auth

Convex Auth is a library for implementing authentication directly within your
[Convex](https://convex.dev) backend. This allows you to authenticate users
without needing an authentication service or even a hosting server. Your
application can be:

- a React SPA served from a CDN
- a full-stack Next.js app
- React Native mobile app

**NOTE:** Convex Auth is very new. Please share any feedback you have on
[Discord](https://convex.dev/community).

Convex Auth enables you to implement the following authentication methods:

1. [Magic Links](/config/email) & [OTPs](/config/otps) - send a link or code via
   email
2. [OAuth](/config/oauth) - sign in with Github / Google / Apple etc.
3. [Passwords](/config/passwords) - including password reset flow and optional
   email verification

To get a working authentication system, you'll follow these 3 steps:

1. Set up the library
2. Configure chosen authentication methods
3. Build your UI

The library doesn't come with UI components, but you can copy from the example
repo to quickly build a UI in React.
