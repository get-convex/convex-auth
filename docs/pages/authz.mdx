# Authorization

Now that you have set up and configured authentication with Convex Auth, learn
how to use the authentication state in your frontend and backend.

## Sign in

See each authentication method's [Configuration](/config) page for how to build
a sign-in UI.

## Sign out

You can sign the user out via the `signOut` function:

```tsx filename="src/SignOut.tsx"
"use client";

import { useAuthActions } from "@xixixao/convex-auth/react";

export function SignOut() {
  const { signOut } = useAuthActions();
  return <button onClick={() => void signOut()}>Sign out</button>;
}
```

## Determine what UI to show based on signed-in state

You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the
components from `convex/react`. You can combine them with your custom sign-in
and sign-out components:

```ts filename="src/App.tsx"
import { Authenticated, Unauthenticated, AuthLoading } from "convex/react";
import { SignIn } from "./SignIn";
import { SignOut } from "./SignOut";

export function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <AuthLoading>{/* consider showing a loading indicator */}</AuthLoading>
      <Unauthenticated>
        <SignIn />
      </Unauthenticated>
      <Authenticated>
        <SignOut />
        <Content />
      </Authenticated>
    </>
  );
}

function Content() {
  /* render signed-in content */
}
```

## Use authentication state in backend functions

Within a Convex [function](https://docs.convex.dev/functions), you can access
information about the currently logged-in user and session via the `auth` object
exported from your `convex/auth.ts` file.

The `auth.getUserId` and `auth.getSessionId` methods use the Convex-built-in
`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` under the hood to provide a typed API.

### Data model

Convex Auth defines [`users`](/api_reference/server#users) and
[`sessions`](<(/api_reference/server#sessions)>) tables for you.

When a user first signs up, a document is created in the `users` table.

When a user signs in (including after initial signup), a document is created in
the `sessions` table. The session document exists until the session expires or
the user signs out. See
[session document lifecycle](/advanced#session-document-lifecycle).

One user can have many active sessions simultaneously. For web apps the same
session is shared by all browser tabs by default, but
[this can be configured](/api_reference/react#convexauthprovider).

### Get currently signed-in user ID

To get the currently signed-in user's ID, call `auth.getUserId` and pass it a
query, mutation or action `ctx`:

```ts filename="convex/myFunctions.tsx"
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { auth } from "./auth";

export const currentUser = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const userId = await auth.getUserId(ctx);
    if (userId === null) {
      return null;
    }
    return await ctx.db.get(userId);
  },
});
```

The function returns `Id<"users">` (or `null` when the client isn't
authenticated).

### Get current session ID

To get the current session ID, call `auth.getSessionId` and pass it a query,
mutation or action `ctx`:

```ts filename="convex/myFunctions.tsx"
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { auth } from "./auth";

export const currentSession = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const sessionId = await auth.getSessionId(ctx);
    if (sessionId === null) {
      return null;
    }
    return await ctx.db.get(sessionId);
  },
});
```

The function returns `Id<"sessions">` (or `null` when the client isn't
authenticated).

### Loading users and sessions

You can retrieve the user or session document via `ctx.db.get()` in queries and
mutations.

See [Customizing Schema] for guidance on attaching additional information to
users and sessions.
