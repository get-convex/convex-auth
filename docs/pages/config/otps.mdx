# OTPs

> Make sure you're done with [setup](/setup) before configuring authentication
> methods

This authentication method has two steps:

1. The user provides an email address or a phone number, to which a
   one-time-password (OTP) code is sent
2. The user then fills out the code within your app

Your database keeps track of the issued code that was sent which allows for
secure verification and expiration.

You will configure your message template, so you can send an OTP and a
[magic link](/config/email) together.

## Email providers

Convex Auth implements configuration via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
"provider" configs. These JS objects define how the library sends emails.

Open the
[Auth.js Magic Links providers doc](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email)
to see a list of available email providers.

Choose an email provider (for example _Resend_) and follow the guide below.

_Ignore the "database provider" configuration in Auth.js docs. Your Convex
backend is your database!_

## Setup

<Steps>

### Environment variables

Configure the relevant environment variables for a given email provider, as per
Auth.js docs, on your Convex backend.

See
[setting environment variables Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#setting-environment-variables).

For example for _Resend_, after you sign up and obtain your API key, you can run
(with your own value):

```sh
npx convex env set AUTH_RESEND_KEY yourresendkey
```

### Provider configuration

Create a custom provider config for sending an OTP.

<Aside title="This example uses additional dependencies">

1. The Resend SDK (`resend` on NPM)
2. `oslo`, a handy library which is part of the Lucia project

You can install these with `npm i resend oslo`.

</Aside>

```ts filename="convex/ResendOTP.ts"
import { Email } from "@convex-dev/auth/providers/Email";
import { Resend as ResendAPI } from "resend";
import { alphabet, generateRandomString } from "oslo/crypto";

export const ResendOTP = Email({
  id: "resend-otp",
  apiKey: process.env.AUTH_RESEND_KEY,
  maxAge: 60 * 15, // 15 minutes
  // This function can be asynchronous
  generateVerificationToken() {
    return generateRandomString(8, alphabet("0-9"));
  },
  async sendVerificationRequest({ identifier: email, provider, token }) {
    const resend = new ResendAPI(provider.apiKey);
    const { error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: "My App <onboarding@resend.dev>",
      to: [email],
      subject: `Sign in to My App`,
      text: "Your code is " + token,
    });

    if (error) {
      throw new Error(JSON.stringify(error));
    }
  },
});
```

Then use it in `convex/auth.ts`:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";
import { ResendOTP } from "./ResendOTP";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
  providers: [ResendOTP],
});
```

Check out the
[example repo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/convex/otp/ResendOTP.ts)
for a more polished email template, including using `React` for the email
templating (add `"jsx": "react-jsx"` to your `convex/tsconfig.json`).

You can find more examples of email customization in
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/resend#customization).

### Add sign-in form

Now you can trigger the email sending from a form submission via the `signIn`
function.

After the email is sent, you should show a second form for submitting the code.
When the second form is submitted, call the `signIn` function again.

For example for the custom `ResendOTP` provider:

```tsx filename="src/SignIn.tsx"
import { useAuthActions } from "@convex-dev/auth/react";
import { useState } from "react";

export function SignIn() {
  const { signIn } = useAuthActions();
  const [step, setStep] = useState<"signIn" | { email: string }>("signIn");
  return step === "signIn" ? (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
        void signIn("resend-otp", formData).then(() =>
          setStep({ email: formData.get("email") as string })
        );
      }}
    >
      <input name="email" placeholder="Email" type="text" />
      <button type="submit">Send code</button>
    </form>
  ) : (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
        void signIn("resend-otp", formData);
      }}
    >
      <input name="code" placeholder="Code" type="text" />
      <input name="email" value={step.email} type="hidden" />
      <button type="submit">Continue</button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setStep("signIn")}>
        Cancel
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

The second call to `signIn` will include the user-provided `code`. Because this
is a short code, we must also provide the `email` that matches the account used
for the sign-in. The library automatically rate-limits failed attempts.

Check out the
[example repo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/src/auth/SignInFormEmailCode.tsx)
for a more polished UI.

</Steps>

When you're done configuring your chosen authentication methods, learn how to
use authentication in your frontend and backend in [Authorization](/authz).

## Phone providers

There are no built-in providers, but one is easy to build. The example repo has
an example of using
[Twilio and their Node.js SDK](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/convex/otp/TwilioOTP.ts).

The sign-in form works the same as above, but uses a `phone` field instead of an
`email` field:
[example](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/src/auth/SignInFormPhoneCode.tsx).

If you use a third-party service that takes care of generating and validating
OTPs, you can use a custom
[`ConvexCredentials`](/api_reference/providers/ConvexCredentials) config to
implement the authentication method. The example repo shows how to do this with
the
[Twilio Verify service](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/convex/otp/TwilioOTP.tsx).
