# OAuth

> Make sure you're done with [setup](/setup) before configuring authentication
> methods

This authentication method has two steps:

1. The user clicks on a button to sign-in with a third-party (GitHub, Google,
   Apple etc.)
2. The user authenticates on the third-party website and is redirected back to
   your app and signed in

Convex Auth ensures a secure exchange of secrets between the third-party
provider and your backend.

## Providers

Convex Auth implements configuration via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
"provider" configs. These JS objects define how the library interfaces with an
OAuth provider.

Convex supports using [GitHub](oauth/github), [Google](oauth/google) and
[Apple](oauth/apple) as OAuth providers. You can also try any of the 80 OAuth
providers bundled with Auth.js (see the list in the sidebar of
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/github)), but note
that **we don't provide support for using these other providers**.

See the individual guides for the supported providers above or follow the
general setup instructions below for the provider of your choice.

_Ignore the "database provider" configuration in Auth.js docs. Your Convex
backend is your database!_

  Are you setting up OAuth for the first time? We recommend using
  [GitHub](oauth/github).
</Callout>

## General OAuth Setup

The instructions below should apply to any OAuth provider. If you're using one
of our supported providers, prefer following the dedicated setup guide for the
provider you've chosen instead.

<Steps>

### Callback URL

After you sign up as a developer with the provider you usually create an "app"
(or similar) to store your OAuth configuration.

Among other things you might need to configure you will usually need to specify
a "callback" URL, and potentially other URLs/domains.

The origin (domain) of the callback URL for Convex Auth is your backend's HTTP
Actions URL, which you can find on your
[Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings). It matches
your `CONVEX_URL` except for the the top-level domain being `.site` instead of
`.cloud`.

For example, if your deployment name was `fast-horse-123`, then your HTTP
Actions URL would be `https://fast-horse-123.convex.site` and your callback URL
for _GitHub_ would be:

```
https://fast-horse-123.convex.site/api/auth/callback/github
```

### Environment variables

Configure the relevant environment variables for a given OAuth provider, as per
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers), on your Convex
backend.

[Setting environment variables Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#setting-environment-variables).

For example for _GitHub_ you can run (with your own values):

```sh
npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_ID yourgithubclientid
npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET yourgithubsecret
```

Also check that the `SITE_URL` variable has the correct port number
[configured](/setup/manual#configure-site_url).

### Provider configuration

Add the provider config to the `providers` array in `convex/auth.ts`.

Import Auth.js providers from `@auth/core/providers`. For example for _GitHub_:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import GitHub from "@auth/core/providers/github";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
});
```

### Add sign-in button

Now you can trigger the OAuth sign-in flow from a button click via the Convex
Auth `signIn` function.

<Tabs items={['React', 'React Native']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

The first argument to the function is the provider ID, which unless customized
is a lowercase version of the provider name. For example for _GitHub_:

```tsx filename="src/SignIn.tsx"
import { useAuthActions } from "@convex-dev/auth/react";

export function SignIn() {
  const { signIn } = useAuthActions();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => void signIn("github")}>Sign in with GitHub</button>
  );
}
```

Check out the
[example repo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/src/auth/oauth/SignInWithGitHub.tsx)
for a more polished UI.

You can control which page the user will be redirected to after the sign-in by
passing a `redirectTo` param to the `signIn` function. See
[`redirect` callback](/api_reference/server#callbacksredirect).

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

The first argument to the function is the provider ID, which unless customized
is a lowercase version of the provider name.

With React Native, on mobile, your app performs two steps:

1. The first call to `signIn` returns the URL to open in the in-app browser via
   [`openAuthSessionAsync`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser/#webbrowseropenauthsessionasyncurl-redirecturl-options).
2. After the in-app browser redirects back to your app, the second call to
   `signIn` actually signs the client in with the `code` param from the final
   redirect URL.

The
[`makeRedirectUri`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/auth-session/#authsessionmakeredirecturioptions)
function is used to create the URL for your app.

This code leverages the `expo-auth-session` package, install it via
`npm i expo-auth-session`.

```tsx filename="app/SignIn.tsx"
import { useAuthActions } from "@convex-dev/auth/react";
import { makeRedirectUri } from "expo-auth-session";
import { openAuthSessionAsync } from "expo-web-browser";
import { Button, Platform } from "react-native";

const redirectTo = makeRedirectUri();

function SignIn() {
  const { signIn } = useAuthActions();
  const handleSignIn = async () => {
    const { redirect } = await signIn("github", { redirectTo });
    if (Platform.OS === "web") {
      return;
    }
    const result = await openAuthSessionAsync(redirect!.toString(), redirectTo);
    if (result.type === "success") {
      const { url } = result;
      const code = new URL(url).searchParams.get("code")!;
      await signIn("github", { code });
    }
  };
  return <Button onPress={handleSignIn} title="Sign in with GitHub" />;
}
```

If you're only targeting mobile you can
[configure SITE_URL](/setup/manual#configure-site_url) to match your app's URL.

If you need to support multiple `redirectTo` URL schemes or origins, you must
override the [`redirect` callback](/api_reference/server#callbacksredirect), for
example:

```ts convex/auth.ts
import GitHub from "@auth/core/providers/github";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
  callbacks: {
    async redirect({ redirectTo }) {
      if (
        redirectTo !== "exp://10.0.1.30:8081" &&
        redirectTo !== "http://localhost:3000"
      ) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid redirectTo URI ${redirectTo}`);
      }
      return redirectTo;
    },
  },
});
```

</Steps>

When you're done configuring your chosen authentication methods, learn how to
use authentication in your frontend and backend in [Authorization](/authz).

## Production setup

It's usually not possible to share the same OAuth provider "app", the entity
configured on the third-party dashboard, between your development and production
environments.

In development your app is usually running on `localhost`, while in production
it will be hosted on a public server and have a proper assigned URL.

Therefore you will have to create a separate "app" on the third-party dashboard
for each environment, and configure the [callback URL](#callback-url) and
[environment variables](#environment-variables) accordingly.

Don't forget to also
[configure your SITE_URL](/setup/manual/#configure-site_url).

## Retrieving other profile information

By default, only `name`, `email` and `image` sourced from the OAuth profile are
saved in the `users` table.

You can find the logic for sourcing these fields
[here](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth/blob/main/src/server/provider_utils.ts#L92-L99).

You can customize this logic via the `profile` method on the OAuth provider
config:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import GitHub from "@auth/core/providers/github";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
  providers: [
    GitHub({
      profile(githubProfile, tokens) {
        return {
          id: githubProfile.id,
          name: githubProfile.name,
          email: githubProfile.email,
          image: githubProfile.picture,
          githubId: githubProfile.id,
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

The example above adds a `githubId` field. You must
[customize your schema](/setup/schema) to include this field.

To implement the `profile` method correctly you must understand the profile
information the particular OAuth provider returns. Consult their documentation.

The method must return an `id` field with a unique ID, which is used to identify
the [account](/advanced#account-linking).
