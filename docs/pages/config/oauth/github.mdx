## Instructions

Follow these instructions to configure Convex Auth to use **GitHub OAuth** in a
development environment.

<Steps>
### Open the Github OAuth app registration form

<details>
  <summary>
    You can [navigate directly to the
    form](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) or expand for detailed
    manual steps.
  </summary>
  1. Sign in to github.com in your web browser 2. Click on your user avatar in the
  top-right of the page 3. In the menu that opens, click **Settings** 4. Scroll down
  and click **Developer settings** in the menu on the left 5. Click **OAuth Apps**
  in the menu on the left 6. Click the **New OAuth App** button
</details>

### Fill out the form with your app details

You can name your app whatever you like, but note that the name and description
will be presented to users when they attempt to login with GitHub for your
application.

For the **Homepage URL**, use `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever local address
your development server uses).

For the **Authorization callback URL**, first find the HTTP Actions URL for your
Convex deployment. You can find that in the
[Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) under **Settings -> URL &
Deploy Key -> Show development credentials**.

<Callout type="info">
  Your HTTP Actions URL will match your Deployment URL, except it will end in
  `.site` instead of `.cloud`.
</Callout>

The full **Authorization callback URL** will be your actions URL plus
`api/auth/callback/github`. So if your actions URL is
`https://fast-horse-123.convex.site` then your callback URL will be:

```
https://fast-horse-123.convex.site/api/auth/callback/github
```

Once you've filled in that info, click the **Register application** button.

### Set Convex environment variables for GitHub OAuth

Keep the GitHub page with your new application details open.

Open a terminal to your Convex application directory.

<Callout type="info">
  Environment variables can also be configured in the [Convex
  dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) under `Settings -> Environment
  variables`.
</Callout>

Copy the **Client ID** value from the GitHub page and supply it as the last
argument to the following command (run in your terminal):

```
npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_ID <yourgithubclientid>
```

Then click the **Generate a new client secret** button back on the GitHub OAuth
app settings page.

Copy that value and use it as the last argument to the following command (run in
your terminal):

```
npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET <yourgithubsecret>
```

### Provider configuration in auth.ts

Add the provider config to the `providers` array in `convex/auth.ts`. The
`GitHub` provider will read the client ID and secret that you supplied in the
environment variables above.

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import GitHub from "@auth/core/providers/github";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
});
```

### App integration

See the [general OAuth instructions](../oauth#add-sign-in-button) for how to add
a sign-in button in your application.
