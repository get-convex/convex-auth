## Instructions

Follow these instructions to configure Convex Auth to use **Google OAuth** in a
development environment.

The instructions expect that you have a Google developer account. If you don't
have one yet, be sure to do that first. Visit
[Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/) to ensure that your
developer account is ready to go.

Additionally, the instructions cover the full configuration of Google Auth for a
Google Cloud project. If you are working with an existing project, it's possible
that some of the steps below won't apply.

<Steps>
### Create or open a Google Cloud project

Open the [Google Auth Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview)
overview and select or create a project.

### Configure Google Auth for your project

Once you have a project created or selected, click the **GET STARTED** button on
the **Overview** page.

Provide the **App name** which will be shown to users.

Select a **User support email**.

Click **NEXT**.

Choose whether you're creating an app for an **Internal** or **External**
audience. If you're making a public application, choose **External**.

Click **NEXT**.

Enter email addresses for **Contact Information**.

Click **NEXT**.

Review the User Data Policy and check the box if you agree.

Click **CONTINUE**.

Click **CREATE**.

#### Configure audience for external app

If you chose an **external** app, click **Audience** in the left menu and add
some email accounts of test users that you want to use to test your integration.

### Configure an OAuth client

Click the **Clients** option in the left menu.

Click **Create client**

Select "Web Application" as the client type.

Choose a name - this won't be shown to users, it's just for your organizational
purposes.

For **Authorized JavaScript origins** enter `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever
local address your development server uses)..

For the **Authorized redirect URIs**, first find the HTTP Actions URL for your
Convex deployment. You can find that in the
[Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) under **Settings -> URL &
Deploy Key -> Show development credentials**.

<Callout type="info">
  Your HTTP Actions URL will match your Deployment URL, except it will end in
  `.site` instead of `.cloud`.
</Callout>

The full **Authorized redirect URI** will be your actions URL plus
`api/auth/callback/google`. So if your actions URL is
`https://fast-horse-123.convex.site` then your callback URL will be:

```
https://fast-horse-123.convex.site/api/auth/callback/google
```

Click **CREATE**.

<Callout type="info">
  If you follow the steps above exactly, Google will render the text
  `fast-horse-123.convex.site` in their OAuth consent screen. If you're signed
  up for a Convex Pro account, you can configure Convex Auth in your production
  deployment to show a [custom
  domain](../../advanced#custom-callback-and-sign-in-urls) in that screen
  instead.
</Callout>

### Set Convex environment variables for Google OAuth

Reopen the client configuration.

Open a terminal to your Convex application directory.

<Callout type="info">
  Environment variables can also be configured in the [Convex
  dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) under `Settings -> Environment
  variables`.
</Callout>

Copy the **Client ID** value from the configuration page and supply it as the
last argument to the following command (run in your terminal):

```
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_ID <yourgoogleclientid>
```

Then copy the **Client secret** value from the configuration page and supply it
as the last argument to the following command (run in your terminal):

```
npx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET <yourgooglesecret>
```

### Provider configuration in auth.ts

Add the provider config to the `providers` array in `convex/auth.ts`. The
`Google` provider will read the client ID and secret that you supplied in the
environment variables above.

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import Google from "@auth/core/providers/google";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
  providers: [Google],
});
```

### App integration

See the [general OAuth instructions](../oauth#add-sign-in-button) for how to add
a sign-in button in your application.
