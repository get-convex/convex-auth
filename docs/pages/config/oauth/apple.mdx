# Apple

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to configure Convex Auth to use **Sign in with Apple**
in a development environment.

<Callout type="warning">
  Unlike other providers, Apple doesn't allow you to test your **Sign in with
  Apple** integration using an app running on `localhost`. You'll need to fully
  deploy your application to a public site with a valid SSL certificate.
</Callout>

The instructions expect that you have an Apple developer account. If you don't
have one yet, be sure to do that first. Visit
[Apple's Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/) to ensure that your
developer account is ready to go.

Additionally, the instructions cover the full configuration of **Sign in with
Apple** for a project. If you are working with an existing project, it's
possible that some of the steps below won't apply.

<Steps>
### Create an App ID

Open the Apple's
[Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
page.

Select "App IDs" in the drop down on the right (if it's not already selected)
and click on the `+` button next to **Identifiers**.

On the next page, with "App IDs" selected, click **Continue**.

On the next page, with "App" selected, click **Continue**.

Fill in the **Description** and _Explicit_ **Bundle ID** fields.

Scroll down until you see "Sign in with Apple" in the list and check the box
next to it.

Click **Continue** and then **Register**.

### Create a Service ID

Back on the
[Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
page, use the drop-down on the right and select "Services IDs".

Click the `+` button next to **Identifiers**.

On the next page, with "Services IDs" selected, click **Continue**.

On the next page, fill in the **Description** and **Identifier** fields.

Click **Continue** and then **Register**.

### Create a Key

Click on the [Keys](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list)
entry in the left menu.

Click on the `+` button next to **Keys**.

Enter a **Key Name**, scroll down and check the box next to **Sign in with
Apple**, and then click the **Configure** button beside it.

On the next page, select the **App ID** you just created as the **Primary App
ID** and click the **Save** button.

Back on the **Register a New Key** page, click the **Continue** button, and then
click the **Register** button.

Download the key on the next screen and store it somewhere safe, then click the
**Done** button.

### Configure your callback URL

Back on the
[Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
page, use the drop-down on the right and select "Services IDs".

Click the name of the Service ID you just created earlier.

Ensure that "Sign In with Apple" is checked and click the **Configure** button.

To populate the **Register Website URLs** form, first find the HTTP Actions URL
for your Convex deployment. You can find that in the
[Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) under **Settings -> URL &
Deploy Key -> Show development credentials**.

<Callout type="info">
  Your HTTP Actions URL will match your Deployment URL, except it will end in
  `.site` instead of `.cloud`.
</Callout>

You'll need to copy and paste just the domain portion into **Domains and
Subdomains**.

The full **Return URLs** value will be your actions URL plus
`api/auth/callback/apple`. So if your actions URL is
`https://fast-horse-123.convex.site` then your return URL will be:

```
https://fast-horse-123.convex.site/api/auth/callback/apple
```

Click **Next**.

Confirm that the values are correct and then click **Done**.

Back on the Services ID configuration page, click **Continue** and then
**Save**.

### Set Convex environment variables for Sign in with Apple

Open the
[Services ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId)
page.

Open a terminal to your Convex application directory.

<Callout type="info">
  Environment variables can also be configured in the [Convex
  dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) under `Settings -> Environment
  variables`.
</Callout>

Copy the **IDENTIFIER** value for the Services ID you created earlier and supply
it as the last argument to the following command (run in your terminal):

```
npx convex env set AUTH_APPLE_ID <yourappleserviceidentifier>
```

Now it's time to configure the `AUTH_APPLE_SECRET`. This is the trickiest part
of the process, and it will involve multiple pieces of information that you've
worked with above. In the end, those various bits of information will be
combined to create a signed [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)
that Apple requires for the secret value.

<div className="nx-my-4 nx-rounded nx-border nx-border-gray-200 nx-bg-white nx-p-2 nx-shadow-sm first:nx-mt-0 dark:nx-border-neutral-800 dark:nx-bg-neutral-900">
Use this form (in Chrome or Firefox) to help generate the JWT that you'll use for your `AUTH_APPLE_SECRET`.

<Callout type="info">
  This form is processed entirely in your browser - no data is transmitted over
  the network.
</Callout>

<AppleSecretGenerator/>
</div>

Use the **Secret Key** value that was generated above and set it as the
`AUTH_APPLE_SECRET` environment var.

```
npx convex env set AUTH_APPLE_SECRET <yourapplesecret>
```

<Callout type="warning">
The client secret generated above is only valid for 6 months, which is the
maximum time that Apple allows. After that, you'll need to generate a new secret
and update your environment variables again.
</Callout>

### Provider configuration in auth.ts

Add the provider config to the `providers` array in `convex/auth.ts`. The
`Apple` provider will read the client ID and secret that you supplied in the
environment variables above.

<Callout type="info">
If an Apple user elects to share their name with your application, that only happens the first time that they
authenticate via Sign in with Apple. Because of that, the provider configuration below is a little more complex
than other supported providers.

It ensures that if the user's name is shared, it gets added to the profile which
is included in the `users` table. On future logins, the initial value that was
written will be retained.

</Callout>

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import Apple from "@auth/core/providers/apple";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
  providers: [
    Apple({
      profile: (appleInfo) => {
        const name = appleInfo.user
          ? `${appleInfo.user.name.firstName} ${appleInfo.user.name.lastName}`
          : undefined;
        return {
          id: appleInfo.sub,
          name: name,
          email: appleInfo.email,
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### App integration

See the [general OAuth instructions](../oauth#add-sign-in-button) for how to add
a sign-in button in your application.
