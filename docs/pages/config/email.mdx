# Magic Links

> Make sure you're done with [setup](/setup) before configuring authentication
> methods

This authentication method has two steps:

1. The user provides an email, to which a link is sent
2. The user clicks on the link to reopen your web app and is signed-in

Your database keeps track of the issued link "token" that was sent which allows
for secure verification and expiration.

For React Native or to improve the user experience use the slightly more
advanced [OTP method](/config/otps).

## Email providers

Convex Auth implements configuration via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
"provider" configs. These JS objects define how the library sends emails.

Open the
[Auth.js Magic Links providers doc](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email)
to see a list of available email providers.

Choose an email provider (for example _Resend_) and follow the guide below.

_Ignore the "database provider" configuration in Auth.js docs. Your Convex
backend is your database!_

## Setup

<Steps>

### (optional) Verify your email domain

Before you add and verify your email domain to the email provider service of
your choice, you might only be able to send emails to the address you signed up
with, or your emails might be marked as spam. See the dedicated Auth.js docs
page for each provider, for example
[Resend](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/resend).

### Environment variables

Configure the relevant environment variables for a given email provider, as per
Auth.js docs, on your Convex backend.

See
[setting environment variables Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#setting-environment-variables).

For example for _Resend_, after you sign up and obtain your API key, you can run
(with your own value):

```sh
npx convex env set AUTH_RESEND_KEY yourresendkey
```

Also check that the `SITE_URL` variable has the correct port number
[configured](/setup/manual#configure-site_url).

### Provider configuration

Add the provider config to the `providers` array in `convex/auth.ts`.

Import Auth.js providers from `@auth/core/providers`. For example for _Resend_:

```ts filename="convex/auth.ts"
import Resend from "@auth/core/providers/resend";
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store } = convexAuth({
  providers: [Resend],
});
```

### Add sign-in form

Now you can trigger the email sending from a form submission via the Convex Auth
`signIn` function.

The first argument to the function is the provider ID, which unless customized
is a lowercase version of the provider name. For example for _Resend_:

```tsx filename="src/SignIn.tsx"
import { useAuthActions } from "@convex-dev/auth/react";

export function SignIn() {
  const { signIn } = useAuthActions();
  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
        void signIn("resend", formData);
      }}
    >
      <input name="email" placeholder="Email" type="text" />
      <button type="submit">Send sign-in link</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Check out the
[example repo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example/blob/main/src/auth/SignInFormEmailLink.tsx)
for a more polished UI.

You can find more examples of email customization in
[Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/resend#customization).

You can control which page the link takes the user to by passing a `redirectTo`
param to the `signIn` function. See
[`redirect` callback](/api_reference/server#callbacksredirect).

</Steps>

When you're done configuring your chosen authentication methods, learn how to
use authentication in your frontend and backend in [Authorization](/authz).

## Security: Preventing Session Fixation or Phishing

When a user clicks on the link in the email, they will be immediately signed in.
This can enable a form of a session fixation attack:

1. Malicious actor M targets a victim V
2. M signs up to your app, and creates an account that looks like V's account
   (for example, uses V's name during sign-up)
3. M generates a magic link
4. M makes V click on the link (via a website, email, instant-messaging) or
   redirects to it from a different webpage
5. V is now instantly signed in to an account that M has access to. Any data
   that V provides to your app, will be accessible by M.

To make this kind of an attack less likely to succeed, you can add an interstial
page that shows the user which email they are signing-in with, and require a
user interaction (button click) to proceed.

You can do this similarly to setting up the [OTP](/config/otps) method:

1. Create a custom email provider via [`Email`](/api_reference/providers/Email)
2. Change the link so that it includes the token and the email (but don't use
   the `code` URL param)
   - optionally pick a specific path where your app will handle this flow
   - for example:
     "https://myapp.com/email-sign-in?token=${token}&email=${identifier}"
3. At the specific path (or based on the URL params), render the interstitial
   page with a button
4. When the user clicks on the button, call the `signIn` function with `code`
   and `email` params.
   - Providers created via [`Email`](/api_reference/providers/Email)
     automatically check that the `email` matches the `email` used for sending
     the token, so the malicious actor cannot spoof it.
